Three of the top four writers in the list are women, and you've probably never heard of one of them. One writer in the chart admitted to plagiarizing another in 1997. Another author was killed in a duel. Dive in with this interactive infographic.",

To accomplish the first goal, I combed through U.S. census data and found some interesting trends in the migration patterns of Americans at different income levels. For the second objective, I chose to emulate the style of FiveThirtyEight (as it looked in fall 2015). The resemblance is purely for educational purposes.",
